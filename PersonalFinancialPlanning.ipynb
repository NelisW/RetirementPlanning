    "This notebook is a collection of calculations attempting to understand the positive (growth) and negative elements (cost and risk) in investments. It is not even considering dealing on the equity markets or other sophisticated financial instruments, but rather investigating small, longer-term, personal-scale  investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A note on dates:**  The default start date in this notebook is 2000-01-01, mainly because it is easy to calculate the term remaining from a round number.  The date 0000-01-01 is not allowed in the Python code, so I start with the year 2000.\n",

    "In South Africa we use ZAR (R) as monetary unit but I do not use the notation, simply because the same calculations apply irrespective of the monetary unit. South African inflation historically varied between 4% and 6% pa, managed by the central bank to target of 6% max.  Our mortgage bond loan interest rate vary from 8.5% to 10% depending on the age of the bond and the client's risk profile.  Numbers in your country will be different, adapt these calculations as necessary for your environment.\n",

    "A *mortgage* is a loan (usually secured by a bond) where the purpose of the loan is to purchase a fixed asset in the name of the borrower, but where the lender has the right to seize the asset if the borrower defaults on payment. The lender's right to seize falls away once the loan is fully repaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *bond* is is a long term load agreement (by contract or certificate) whereby one party undertakes to repay the principal amount of the loan with interest by an agreed date. The term 'bond' is used in this document to imply a bond with a schedule of regular payments, usually monthly. In this notebook the terms bond and mortgage are use mostly equivalently.\n"

    "## Mortgage Bond Amortisation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This model and code is taken from http://pbpython.com/amortization-model-revised.html. Moffit was looking for a way to do amortisation  calculations in Pandas without loops, but ended up using a generator function to do the looping.  The generator does a complete set of loops and then provides the answer to a Pandas DataFrame.   The power of Pandas is therefore not available during the loop, but it is available afterwards for analysis and plotting.  Moffit's original code is heavily refactored and cleaned up here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm to be executed at every time interval (e.g. every month) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the interest on the balance, rounded to two decimals.\n",
    "1. Calculate the payment as the smaller of the outstanding balance or the contractual payment amount (to account for a smaller payment in the last cycle).\n",
    "1. Calculate the additional payment as the smaller of the outstanding balance or the fixed additional payment amount (to account for a smaller payment in the last cycle). \n",
    "1. Calculate the new balance by adding the interest and subtracting the two payments (but account for the signs of the financial values).\n",
    "1. Calculate some housekeeping values like the date and payment cycle number.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be evident that the interest is calculated compound at each payment cycle, hence it adjusts at every payment cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `amortise` function below is a Python generator function that provides iterative results for each time interval.  This generator is used to populate a Pandas DataFrame for subsequent anaysis."

    "\n",
    "Study the cash flow over some extended period `calcyears` when buying a property against a bonded loan for the purpose of renting it out. The loan can be fully repaid in `bondyears`, before the end of the extended study period. Hence in the initial `bondyears` the loan requires interest payment (as a cost against the property) and after the `bondyears` period, the interest is zero, with the property returning a positive inflow of cash.  The intent is to determine the effect of bond duration on the total cash flow over the extended period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the loan amount, interest rate and other parameters, an additional payment is required to repay the loan at the end of the `bondyears` period. Hence, in the initial years the investment is cash flow negative as the loan is repaid.  The investment should become cash flow positive after the loan in repaid.  The question remains: over the extended analysis period, **what was the net cumulative cash flow?**  The smaller (or more negative) the net cumulative cash flow is, the poorer investment is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we assume that the additional loan down payment funds are free (no costs or losses in removing the funds from other investments).\n",
    "We also assume that the tax is payable every month, whereas in real life, the tax is only payable on predetermined dates (once or twice per year).\n",
    "The model allows for annual increase in rental income, rates and taxes, renting agency fees and levies. The tax benefit is also applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes that the rental income is paid towards depleting the bond (not removed as personal income).\n",
    "\n",
    "The costs include: \n",
    "1. bond interest, cost of the loan, expressed as a percentage on outstanding balance.\n",
    "1. maintenance, fix and maintain the property, expressed as percentage of rental income. Reasonable values should be 2% to 10% depending on the condition of the property. \n",
    "If it is a full-title property there should be no levies, but this maintenance cost should be higher.\n",
    "If it is a sectional-title property there should be higher levies, but this maintenance cost should be lower, because much of the maintenance is already included in the levy.\n",
    "1. renting agents fee (if applicable), expressed as percentage of rental income. It is convenient to use an agency to find renters and manage the rent agreement. Normally this is 7% to 10% of the rent.\n",
    "1. levies (if applicable), if the property is part of a sectional title scheme.  This can also be used to include any costs to maintain buildings, gardens, etc.\n",
    "1. Local government statutory rates and taxes.\n",
    "1. risk of less than 100% occupancy, defaulting rent payments, damage to property, other other expenses arising from poor tenant behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** the time value of money is not accounted for here, hence the situation is actually worse than what this analysis shows: we use expensive money to repay the loan early and earn cheap money positive cash flow later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** this analysis only considers the rental income and costs against this income.  The **capital growth is not considered at all in the present analysis**, it will be added later.\n",

Instead of having to pick individual investments yourself, a unit trust offers you exposure to a range of assets, which are selected and managed by investment professionals. Each fund is divided into equal units. The price of each of these units is based on the value of all the investments in the fund. As an investor, you own a number of units in a fund. Over time, the price of these units will track the value of the underlying investments. \n",

Our unit trusts charge an annual management fee which is calculated daily.

For more information, please view our Fee Schedule in the forms section on Coronation.co.za. \"\n",

    "A key question when it comes to retirement, is 'how long will the money last?'\n",
    "The answer to this question depends on very many factors including predictable and unpredictable factors\n",
    "Unpredictable factors include new investment opportunities and risks such as ill health, market crashes and crime. The answer also depends somewhat on (uncontrollable) factors that can be estimated or at least modelled by making reasonable assumptions.  These factors include investment growth and inflation, which we can use in models to predict outcomes, given the occurrence of these factors.  These assumptions can be long term averages (assuming stationary conditions) or can be variable on the time line, our modelling must just be able to handle these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Four Percent Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Fund managers currently advise that you do not with draw more than 4% to 5% per year of your total investment portfolio, in order to outlive your retirement funds. This is known as the [four percent rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp). This means that if you saved 1000k, the annual withdrawal should not be more than 40k to 50k. Put differently, you need a portfolio of 25 to 20 times your required annual pension. If you want to retire with 1m per year, you need a portfolio of 25m.\n",
    "The purpose with this analysis is to confirm this advice and to determine the assumptions made in this general advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [four percent rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp) aims to ensure that you do not run out of money during requirement.  The idea is that investment growth will normally be sufficient to cover a four percent withdrawal from the investments per annum.  This rule is based on 50-year data prior to the mid 1970's in the US\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule is not always valid for all people.  As people grow older or require more medical care the the four percent withdrawal may not sustain until death. If the person has high risk investments too high a withdrawal rate (even four percent) may pose a risk in later years.  Occasional high spending may also erode the investment to prevent long term returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis below provides some insight into the role of percentage withdrawals on the sustainability of long term retirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time value of money\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation and investment have the effect of predicting very large numbers in the longer term.  These large numbers are difficult to interpret from the present; we loose the 'feel' of what money really is worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose it is possible to freeze the time value of money, to always retain a constant buying power.  With the time value of money frozen, we can evaluate the value of asset growth and costs in a manner decoupled from the erosion effect of inflation: we evaluate the investment or cost in terms of  true buying power.  The money value would always have constant buying power irrespective of time into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle used here is similar to the financial tool called Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) except that the target calculation here is to determine the time when the investment will be depleted given constant monthly withdrawal that probably exceeds the monthly growth, eating away into the investment capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Freezing the time value of money is readily done by considering any costs or growth relative to the inflation rate. Simply subtract the inflation rate from investment growth and from cost growth.  \n",
    "If the inflation rate is 6% and an investment realises 8% growth after tax and costs, the real growth (corrected for inflation) is 2%. If medical inflation rises by 9% in a 6% inflation economy, it means that in real terms the medical costs increases by 3% per year.  Hence the effect of inflation on time value of money can be removed by considering all costs and growth relative to inflation: just subtract inflation rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retirement fund depletion: simple model, assuming stationary markets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the (simple) initial study shown below, long term average values are used (constant over the full term duration).  This is quite limiting in that long average are not good predictors, but at least it gives us an idea of what could happen under stationary conditions.  However, there is sufficient evidence that investment returns are not stationary, not even in the longer term. For this purpose a more representative model using actual market movements and Monte Carlo simulations will be developed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this a a very simple model, assuming stationary conditions (other than inflation).\n",
    "A more advanced model can have time varying inflation, cost, and investment growth, but the underlying principle would still remain: subtract the inflation rate from the cost and investment growth rates."

    "\n",
    "1. Start with an initial investment value, a single number of the investment portfolio total value.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterate on a monthly interval and repeat the following calculation:\n",

    "    1. Withdraw money from the portfolio (pension to live from, medical costs, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Allow the withdrawal amount to rise in the next month by a percentage equal to the actual rise percentage minus the inflation percentage. In other words, allow the withdrawal to rise in real terms, corrected for inflation.  We allow this growth to assure that medical inflation will be covered (medical inflation is generally higher than cost of living inflation).\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Add a portfolio investment growth amount as expected % growth minus % inflation for the month. In other words add the real growth, corrected for inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Repeat month by month, until the money runs out.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is really simple with several failings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inflation and investment growth are not stationary and often vary in contrary motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Different investment classes perform differently, with different risks and different cycles. To simplify growth in into a single number is a gross simplification of the real situation.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The *first row* is the 'Four percent rule' which means that in the first year of pension 4% or 1/25 of the total investment is withdrawn.  It is clear that if there is zero growth above inflation, and the withdrawal is kept constant at the same percentage (above inflation), the investment should last until the age of 90 (about 25 years).  On the other hand, with a 4% growth above inflation and constant withdrawal rate, the money should last more than 55 years (the simulation terminates at 55 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The *first column* `g0.00, w0.00` represents the scenario with zero annual growth (above inflation) and zero annual withdrawal increase (above inflation). The column shows that as the initial withdrawal increases from the minimum 2.5% to the maximum 17.5% allowed in South Africa, the pension duration shrinks from thirty years to just five and half years!\n"

This is true in younger years, but in elder years a nominally healthy person also incurs considerable expenses in the form of medication and preventative medical care. As the body breaks down, even in healthy people medical costs rise.\n",
    "Medical cost is a given: in sick people it is the cost of caring and repairing, in nominally healthy people it is the cost of maintaining and preventing. Either way, the cost is there.

On average over the whole term, you can increase the withdrawal rate to the investment growth rate without affecting the term.
